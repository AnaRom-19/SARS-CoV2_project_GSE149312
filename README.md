This is a re-analysis of the available RNA-seq dataset (GSE149312) from the publication by Mart M. Lamers et al., titled "SARS-CoV-2 productively infects human gut enterocytes", published in Science 369, 50-54 (2020). DOI:10.1126/science.abc1669. The analysis focused on 6 samples from this dataset: human intestinal organoids cultivated in expansion (EXP) medium, both uninfected and infected with SARS-CoV2 at 24h or 60h post-infection (each condition with 2 replicates). Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2, it included visualizations, functional enrichment analysis (overrepresentation analysis with Enrichr and gProfiler; ranking-based enrichment analysis with GSEA) and topology-based pathway analysis, all conducted in R.
